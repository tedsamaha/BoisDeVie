        <h1>Company Profile</h1>
        <br />
        Bois De Vie, based in Mansourieh Lebanon, in 2014. Our primary business
        is to supply architects, interior designers and residential clients with
        all forms and styles of hand-made furniture, cabinetry or architectural
        woodwork. Since its inception, BDV has supplied museum quality custom
        furniture for residential and select corporate environments garnering
        the respect of leading architects and designers worldwide
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          Bois De Vie actively takes part in furniture making while also
          directing the work of five senior cabinetmakers. Most of our employees
          have been with the company since the start. Each project is managed on
          a daily basis by meetings between all members of the shop every
          morning.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Only one project is taken by each senior cabinetmaker at a time,
          ensuring that each piece of furniture is guided carefully from the
          drawing phase through finishing stages and to the client’s home. We
          routinely receive compliments from our clients with respect to our
          professionalism and craftsmanship.
        </p>
        <br />
        Our clients actively participate in the ongoing decisions affecting
        their projects and are encouraged to visit the shop during the
        construction phases. Most find this experience interesting and
        rewarding.
        <br />

          types of residential and corporate spaces. We undertake and manage

        <h1>Finishing System’s Characteristics</h1>
        <p>
          BDVs finishing system is a deep penetrating finish and not a film
          forming finish. Advantages of a penetrating finish is the elasticity
          of the finish which is flexible enough to move with wood as it shrinks
          and swells

          Maintenance Methods
        </h1>
        <p>
          Wood and veneer are affected by light. For the first couple of weeks,
          do not place any items on the wood pieces as it is absorbing the UV
          rays which changes the color of the wood to a more homogeneous
          tonality.
